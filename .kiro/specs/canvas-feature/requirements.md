# Canvas Feature Requirements

## Introduction

The Canvas feature transforms ChatOllama into a canvas-centric collaborative platform where users work together with AI to create, iterate, and perfect any type of digital content in real-time. The canvas takes center stage as the primary workspace, with AI chat as a supporting tool. Users can create anything from documents and diagrams to web pages and interactive prototypes, seeing live previews as they collaborate with AI. The experience prioritizes the creative output over the conversation, making the canvas the heart of the entire application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Canvas-Centric Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want the canvas to be the primary focus of the interface, so that I can see my work prominently while collaborating with AI.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens a canvas THEN the system SHALL dedicate 70-80% of the screen space to the canvas preview/editor
2. WHEN a user interacts with the canvas THEN the chat interface SHALL remain accessible but unobtrusive (floating dialog or narrow side panel)
3. WHEN a user creates a new canvas THEN the system SHALL immediately show the canvas editor with AI chat ready for collaboration
4. WHEN a user switches between canvases THEN the system SHALL maintain the canvas-centric layout
5. WHEN the canvas contains live content (HTML/CSS/JS) THEN the system SHALL show real-time preview updates as changes are made

### Requirement 2: Real-Time Collaborative Creation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to collaborate with AI to build any type of digital content and see live results immediately, so that I can iterate quickly and achieve my vision.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user describes what they want to create THEN the AI SHALL generate initial content and display it live in the canvas
2. WHEN the AI makes changes to the content THEN the system SHALL update the live preview instantly
3. WHEN a user requests modifications THEN the AI SHALL apply changes incrementally while preserving the user's intent
4. WHEN building different content types THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate editing and preview environments (markdown for documents, SVG for diagrams, HTML/CSS/JS for web content, etc.)
5. WHEN the user provides feedback THEN the AI SHALL understand the context from the current canvas state and make appropriate adjustments
6. WHEN collaboration is active THEN the system SHALL show visual indicators of AI activity and changes being applied

### Requirement 3: Floating Chat Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chat interface to be accessible but not dominate the screen, so that I can focus on my canvas while still communicating with AI.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user needs to chat with AI THEN the system SHALL provide either a floating dialog or narrow side panel (user preference)
2. WHEN the chat interface is minimized THEN the system SHALL show a small indicator for new AI messages
3. WHEN a user sends a message THEN the chat SHALL remain visible until the AI responds and applies changes to the canvas
4. WHEN AI is working on the canvas THEN the chat SHALL show progress indicators and what changes are being made
5. WHEN the user wants to focus entirely on the canvas THEN the system SHALL allow hiding the chat interface completely
6. WHEN chat is hidden THEN the system SHALL provide a quick access button to bring it back

### Requirement 4: Artifact-Focused Collaboration

**User Story:** As a user, I want AI to understand my creative intent and help me build polished content, so that I can achieve professional results through natural conversation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user describes a project (e.g., "create a technical diagram", "write a report", "build a web page") THEN the AI SHALL create a complete initial version in the appropriate format
2. WHEN a user requests changes (e.g., "make it more visual", "add more detail", "improve the layout") THEN the AI SHALL modify the existing content while maintaining structure and intent
3. WHEN building different content types THEN the AI SHALL follow best practices for that medium (proper document structure, clear diagrams, accessible web design, etc.)
4. WHEN the user provides feedback THEN the AI SHALL iterate on the existing work rather than starting over
5. WHEN the content is complex THEN the AI SHALL break down changes into logical steps and explain what it's doing
6. WHEN the user wants to learn THEN the AI SHALL explain the techniques and principles being used

### Requirement 5: Canvas Management and Sharing

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my canvases and share my completed work, so that I can organize my projects and showcase my creations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates multiple canvases THEN the system SHALL provide a canvas library/dashboard for easy access
2. WHEN a user completes a canvas THEN the system SHALL provide sharing options with public URLs
3. WHEN a canvas is shared THEN the system SHALL create a clean, standalone view without editing interface
4. WHEN viewing shared canvases THEN the system SHALL load quickly and work on mobile devices
5. WHEN a user wants to duplicate a canvas THEN the system SHALL create a copy they can modify independently
6. WHEN managing canvases THEN the system SHALL show previews, creation dates, and sharing status

### Requirement 6: Live Preview and Iteration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my work come to life in real-time as I collaborate with AI, so that I can provide immediate feedback and guide the creative process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI creates or modifies content THEN the system SHALL render the result immediately in the canvas preview
2. WHEN content is updated THEN the system SHALL refresh the preview smoothly without losing context
3. WHEN the user sees something they want to change THEN they SHALL be able to point to specific elements and request modifications
4. WHEN building different content types THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate preview modes (rendered markdown, SVG display, web preview, etc.)
5. WHEN the canvas contains interactive elements THEN the system SHALL allow appropriate interaction within the preview
6. WHEN errors occur in the content THEN the system SHALL show helpful error messages and suggest fixes

### Requirement 7: Context-Aware AI Assistance

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to understand the context of my canvas and provide relevant suggestions, so that our collaboration feels natural and productive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks for help THEN the AI SHALL analyze the current canvas content and provide contextually relevant suggestions
2. WHEN the user mentions specific elements THEN the AI SHALL understand references to parts of the canvas (e.g., "make the header bigger")
3. WHEN building web content THEN the AI SHALL suggest improvements for accessibility, performance, and user experience
4. WHEN the user is stuck THEN the AI SHALL proactively offer ideas and next steps based on the current state
5. WHEN the conversation spans multiple topics THEN the AI SHALL maintain focus on canvas-related discussions while allowing general chat
6. WHEN the user wants to learn THEN the AI SHALL provide educational context about the techniques and technologies being used

### Requirement 8: Performance and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want the canvas experience to be fast and responsive, so that I can focus on creating without technical distractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI makes changes to the canvas THEN the system SHALL update the preview within 500ms
2. WHEN the canvas contains complex HTML/CSS/JS THEN the system SHALL maintain smooth performance and responsiveness
3. WHEN switching between canvases THEN the system SHALL load the new canvas within 1 second
4. WHEN the user types in chat THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback and smooth interaction
5. WHEN working on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL adapt the interface appropriately while maintaining core functionality
6. WHEN the canvas is shared publicly THEN the system SHALL optimize loading for viewers without editing capabilities
